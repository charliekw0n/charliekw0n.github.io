        <p>Hi! My name is Charlie and I really like quiches and yo mama jokes. Bagels too. Especially cinnamon raisin. 
            When I'm not slamming my laptop working on CS homework, I'm either playing guitar, drawing, or thrifting. I also like to 
            play soccer, tennis, lacrosse, snowboarding, and I dance a lot too. And finally, I like to drain my wallet by shooting film.

                Something I learned from this article was how to study an app to train myself as a designer. 
                Instead of using the app like one normally would, I should instead focus on things like 
                hierarchy, content, intent, and audience.

                My favorite part of the article was the app deconstruction gifs. They helped me see aspects
                of different apps I hadn't taken notice of before. It also made the article more engaging 
                and interesting to read.

                "When I started off in design, I sucked." This gives me reassurance that I'll get better
                at design.

                8. I liked that it was more interactive than a normal article. Also super straightforward
