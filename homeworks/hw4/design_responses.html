						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that it is not only important to make the color pallete of a webpage look good, 
								but to also ensure to make it "color accessible" for everyone. This can be done through
								color contrast but also not relying solely on color. For example, adding textures to graphs so people
								can differentiate between different colors.  
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part about color contrast. I never knew that there was a 
								ratio to pick colors based off of. I also liked the website they provided, Colorable. I got to play around with the 
							hue, saturation, and lightness of the colors to really see the impact that color contrast makes. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
