        <h3>AN ORIGIN STORY WORTH TELLING...</h3>

        <section class="origin-container">

            

            <p>Top Dog grew out of a boy's love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants' New York home over the WWII years. 
                Steaks? Tubesteaks! His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages 
                were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far to go to a cart or stand offering kosher 
                style "Franks", usually steeped but better off the griddle. Goodness! With kraut n' mustard, please. Raw onions, ketchup 
                (not "catsup") and mayo were unheard of on hot dogs. Burgers maybe ... oh, but that was far away and another day. Then 
                lotsa late nights on the town in San Francisco in the sixties.. but where to find a real natural casing hot dog? 
                Forget it. Doggie Diner was convenient, but ... top dog time! Sampling around for the best frankfurter to sell (and eat!) 
                led to other fine sausages and the idea was born to offer them as hot dogs as well. When no right site could be 
                found in S.F. or Sausalito, hello, Berkeley. That was 1966 and with the paint hardly dry we opened on —surprise— a home 
                football game day. Fifteen minutes later it was full house madness.</p>
